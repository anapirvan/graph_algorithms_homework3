3. Let R = (G, s, t, c) be a transportation network, where c : E(G) → Z∗+ is a non-constant capacity function such that max e∈E(G)
c(e) = O(1). For any cut (S, T) in R denote by E(S, T) = {uv ∈ E : u ∈ S, v ∈ T}. Let α = min {|c(e′) − c(e′′)| : e′, e′′ ∈ E(G), c(e′) ̸= c(e ′′)}. Consider e0 = u0v0 ∈ E and let R0 be the network obtained from R by increasing the capacity of arc e0 by α.
Devise an efficient algorithms for the following problem: decide if e0 ∈ E(S, T), for any minimum capacity cut (S, T) in R. Prove the correctness of this algorithm and estimate its time complexity
