2. The CS department, where there are p students (S = {s1, s2, . . . , sp}), wants to participate
to a CS contest which has three sections: algorithmics, programming, and artificial intelligence. The
department has to form three corresponding teams: at most k1 students for the algorithmic team,
at most k2 students for the programming team, and at most k3 students for the artificial intelligence
team. Each student si composes a list of teams to which she/he is interested to participate in.
In the process of assigning students to teams the following constraints are to be considered:
i) each student is assigned to exactly one team;
(ii) the department has to respect each team capacity;
(iii) a student cannot be assigned to a team which is not on his/her list.
Help the department to solve this problem.
(a) Define a network flow model to allocate the students to the teams.
(b) Give and prove a characterization of the existence of a solution to this problem in terms of a
maximum flow in the above network.
(c) Estimate the time complexity of an appropriate algorithm.
