Let T = (V, E) be a tree. T is called a β-tree if there exists a spanning graph H of T such
that ∆(H) = δ(H) = 1.
(a) Prove that a β-tree of order > 2 has two vertices of degree one each being adjacent to vertices
of degree two.
(b) Let T be a tree of order > 4. Show that if T is a β-tree, then there exists a β-tree T such that
T can be obtained from T by adding two new adjacent vertices: one which will have degree two
in T and one which will have degree one in T.
(c) Is the converse of the above property true?
(d) Devise an efficient algorithm for finding a maximum cardinality matching in a β-tree.

2. The CS department, where there are p students (S = {s1, s2, . . . , sp}), wants to participate
to a CS contest which has three sections: algorithmics, programming, and artificial intelligence. The
department has to form three corresponding teams: at most k1 students for the algorithmic team,
at most k2 students for the programming team, and at most k3 students for the artificial intelligence
team. Each student si composes a list of teams to which she/he is interested to participate in.
In the process of assigning students to teams the following constraints are to be considered:
i) each student is assigned to exactly one team;
(ii) the department has to respect each team capacity;
(iii) a student cannot be assigned to a team which is not on his/her list.
Help the department to solve this problem.
(a) Define a network flow model to allocate the students to the teams.
(b) Give and prove a characterization of the existence of a solution to this problem in terms of a
maximum flow in the above network.
(c) Estimate the time complexity of an appropriate algorithm.
